"""Executor fleet — a pluggable interface over the coding executors the conductor
can drive. The conductor stops being "Claude + Codex" and becomes a FLEET manager:
given the stack the Owner has installed (Claude alone / +Codex / +Kimi / all three),
it knows which frontier tanks are available and how much fuel each has left.

Codex is the PROVEN adapter (live-fire verified). Kimi is STAGED: documented from
Moonshot's Kimi CLI / coding plan but NOT yet reality-checked on a machine where
it's installed — it reports as present-but-unverified and refuses to run until the
same Codex-style live-fire proof is done. Nothing claims to work until proven.
