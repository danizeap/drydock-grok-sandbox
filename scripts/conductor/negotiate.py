"""CLI: two-brain plan negotiation. The pilot (Claude/Fable) drafts a plan and
sends it to Codex (GPT-5.6) as an EQUAL peer for honest push-back — gaps, risks,
blocking concerns, and a proposed task decomposition with per-task owner + model
tier. One invocation is one round; the pilot audits the critique, revises, and
runs another round until Codex converges or the round cap is hit.

Read-only and secret-guarded, built on the same verified codex_bridge primitives
as `review.py` (discover -> gauge -> route -> delegate). Codex's critique is INPUT
to the pilot's judgment, never authoritative — same rule as codex-review.

The bounded loop is the safety property: `--cap` (default 2) guarantees the two
brains cannot burn flagship tokens arguing forever; at the cap the pilot decides.
