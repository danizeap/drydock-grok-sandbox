"""Stop hook: 'done' should mean verified done.

When — and only when — a change packet that looks CLAIMED-DONE (implementation
tasks finished) still has `verification.md` at 'Pending.' AND its content changed
during this session, block the stop ONCE for that packet (session cap 3) with a
precise nudge. Silent in every other case.

Loop safety is the whole game (the platform gives Stop no loop-prevention flag):
- Fail direction is ALWAYS silent-allow. A false block/loop is catastrophic for
  adoption; a missed nudge costs nothing — the archive gates remain the hard
  deterministic backstop. This is the OPPOSITE polarity from the git/secrets guards.
- The nudge is persisted (nudged ledger, atomic write) BEFORE the block is spoken;
  if the write fails for any reason, nothing is emitted — a persistence failure
  degrades to silence, never repetition.
- Discovery + fingerprinting come from the shared `_drydock_common` module, so the
  Stop gate and the SessionStart stamp can never drift apart.
